_3-4 sentences about a problem your team is facing, or has faced, and why it's a problem. You're looking for input, pointers, or even have someone give an Experience Report on the topic if they've solved it. Ideally this is a topic that would appeal to Rails teams of a medium size (for some definition of medium)._
