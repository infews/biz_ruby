_3-4 sentences about a problem your team faced, how you solved it, and what you learned. Ideally this is a topic that would appeal to Rails teams of a medium size (for some definition of medium)._

_You should be ready to give a short 20-30 minute demo or presentation, followed by a spirited discussion on the topic._
