# Experience Reports for Mid-sized Ruby and Rails Shops

Welcome to Biz Ruby, a community of developers at mid-sized Rails shops who wish to share their experience solving real-world problems.

This is an experiment at sharing this information in between more formal conferences. Our primary mechanism is the **Experience Report**, a one hour tech-talk with a light-weight presentation with Q&A. We hope to share information, solve problems, and build a network.

## How to use this Repo

This repo has no code, but the Issues how we propose topics and decide the schedule of Experience Reports.

Each proposal or request is an Issue in this repo as listed below.

If you are interested in attending a report discussed in an issue, assuming it gets scheduled, please up-vote it! When there looks like there is momentum, @infews will reach out to schedule, and ideally record, a session.

## "I have a topic!"

If you have an interesting topic to share, write up a proposal as an Issue, and tag it with "topic proposal."

## "Has anyone else run into this?"

If you have a topic you would like to know more about, or a problem your team is having, write up an Issue as a request and label it with "help wanted."

If you think you can give a report to open disussion on the topic.

## Code of Conduct

We are abiding by the [Conference Code of Conduct][conduct]

## Open Community Issues

There are so many. If you have suggestions, please offer them as Issues and label with "community". Let's discuss!

Thanks for partipacting!
