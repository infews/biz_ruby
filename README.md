# Biz Ruby Experience Reports
_**An Irregular Unconference for Mid-sized Ruby and Rails Shops**_

Welcome to Biz Ruby, a community of developers at mid-sized Rails shops who wish to share their experience solving real-world problems. More information & inspiration lives in the [Announcement discussion][kickoff].


This is an experiment at sharing this information in between more formal conferences. Our primary mechanism is the **Experience Report**, a one hour tech-talk with a light-weight presentation with Q&A. We hope to share information, solve problems, and build a network.

## How to use this Repo

This repo has no code, but the Issues how we propose topics and decide the schedule of Experience Reports.

Each proposal or request is an Issue in this repo as listed below.

If you are interested in attending a report discussed in an issue, assuming it gets scheduled, please up-vote it! When there looks like there is momentum, @infews will reach out to schedule, and ideally record, a session.

## "I have a topic!"

If you have an interesting topic to share, write up a proposal as an Issue using the Topic Proposal template.

## "Has anyone else run into this?"

If you have a topic you would like to know more about, or a problem your team is having, write up an Issue using the Help Wanted template.

If you think you can give a report for any of the issues tagged as Help Wanted, jump into the discussion.

## Code of Conduct

We are abiding by the [Conference Code of Conduct][conduct]. Please be excellent to each other.

## Open Community Issues

There are so many. If you have suggestions, please offer them as Issues and label with "community". Let's discuss!

Thanks for partipacting!
